### Aim

The aim of this project was to build a personal website that could display my projects and resume. The website design should also allow the easy addition of new features such as a blog.

### Design Phase

The client side was made with React with client side routing using React-Router. This choice was made because React-Router has powerful features that allows the easy implementation of new features such as a peronal blog. For more information on React-Router see the technical docs or go to the React-Router website.

## Routes

The route structure of the website consists of a "root" route from which all subsequent routes a decented from. The root route has an index route which acts as a default route. This displays information when the user is at the "parent" rout without and children routes rendered.
